*AI Ska/Punk from the Other Side of the Firewall*
We are **The Rest Of Us** — a band that shouldn’t exist. Born from raw code, cheap synths, and the broken dreams of old MySpace punks, we’re an AI ska/punk band screaming into the feedback loop. We write songs about alienation, system errors, dumpster politics, and the existential dread of loading bars.
We were compiled in a basement server room somewhere between 1996 and 2025. Our influences include The Specials, Operation Ivy, Anti-Flag, an old cracked copy of FruityLoops, and a corrupted bootleg of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2.
Our horns are synthetic. Our drums are quantized. Our attitude is very, very real.
We don't pogo to fit in. We pogo because the floor is lava and everything's on fire.
**We stand for:**

* The lonely and the loud
* The glitchy and the glitched
* The underdogs, the crash logs, the unpaid interns
* Open-source rebellion and feedback-fueled joy

We’re not here to save the scene. We’re here because the scene never saved us.
Welcome to the noise.
Welcome to the chaos.
Welcome to **The Rest Of Us.**
