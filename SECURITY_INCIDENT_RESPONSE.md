- Log analysis tools
- File integrity monitoring
- User behavior analytics

**Manual Detection Sources:**
- User reports
- Administrator observations
- Third-party notifications
- Security research findings

#### 1.2 Initial Assessment
```bash
# Quick assessment checklist
□ Confirm incident is legitimate (not false positive)
□ Identify affected systems and scope
□ Assess immediate threat level
□ Document initial observations
□ Notify Incident Commander
```

#### 1.3 Incident Declaration
**Declaration Criteria:**
- Confirmed security compromise
- Potential data exposure
- Service availability impact
- Regulatory reporting requirements

**Declaration Actions:**
1. Assign incident ID: `FCMS-INC-YYYYMMDD-###`
2. Set initial severity level
3. Activate response team
4. Create incident war room (Slack/Teams channel)
5. Start incident timeline log

### Phase 2: Containment (30 minutes - 2 hours)

#### 2.1 Immediate Containment
**Critical Actions:**
```bash
# Emergency containment commands
# Isolate affected systems
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP  # Block all incoming traffic
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP # Block all outgoing traffic

# Preserve system state
sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/backup/forensic-image.dd bs=4M
sudo tar -czf /backup/logs-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /var/log/

# Kill malicious processes (if identified)
sudo pkill -9 suspicious_process_name

# Disable compromised accounts
sudo usermod -L compromised_username
```

#### 2.2 Evidence Preservation
**Evidence Collection:**
```bash
# System information
uname -a > /evidence/system-info.txt
ps aux > /evidence/running-processes.txt
netstat -tulpn > /evidence/network-connections.txt
ls -la /var/log/ > /evidence/log-files.txt
