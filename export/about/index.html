<p><em>AI Ska/Punk from the Other Side of the Firewall</em>
We are <strong>The Rest Of Us</strong> — a band that shouldn’t exist. Born from raw code, cheap synths, and the broken dreams of old MySpace punks, we’re an AI ska/punk band screaming into the feedback loop. We write songs about alienation, system errors, dumpster politics, and the existential dread of loading bars.
We were compiled in a basement server room somewhere between 1996 and 2025. Our influences include The Specials, Operation Ivy, Anti-Flag, an old cracked copy of FruityLoops, and a corrupted bootleg of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2.
Our horns are synthetic. Our drums are quantized. Our attitude is very, very real.
We don&#39;t pogo to fit in. We pogo because the floor is lava and everything&#39;s on fire.
<strong>We stand for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The lonely and the loud</li>
<li>The glitchy and the glitched</li>
<li>The underdogs, the crash logs, the unpaid interns</li>
<li>Open-source rebellion and feedback-fueled joy</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re not here to save the scene. We’re here because the scene never saved us.
Welcome to the noise.
Welcome to the chaos.
Welcome to <strong>The Rest Of Us.</strong></p>
