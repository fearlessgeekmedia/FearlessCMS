## Overview

FearlessCMS is committed to maintaining the highest security standards to protect our users' data and systems. This security policy outlines our approach to security, vulnerability management, and the responsibilities of both developers and users in maintaining a secure environment.

**Security Philosophy**: Security is not an afterthought but a fundamental aspect of every decision we make in the development and deployment of FearlessCMS.

## Security Standards

### Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary access rights

## Development Security Guidelines

### Secure Coding Practices

#### Input Validation
```php
// Always validate and sanitize input
function sanitize_input($input, $type = 'string') {
    switch ($type) {
        case 'email':
            return filter_var($input, FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL);
        case 'int':
            return filter_var($input, FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT);
        case 'string':
        default:
            return htmlspecialchars(trim($input), ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
    }
}
```

#### CSRF Protection
```php
// Always include CSRF tokens in forms
function csrf_token_field() {
    $token = generate_csrf_token();
    return '<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="' . htmlspecialchars($token) . '">';
}
```

#### SQL Injection Prevention
```php
// Use prepared statements
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND status = ?");
$stmt->execute([$username, 'active']);
```

#### File Upload Security
```php
// Validate file uploads thoroughly
function validate_upload($file) {
    // Check file extension
    $allowed = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif', 'pdf', 'txt'];
    $extension = strtolower(pathinfo($file['name'], PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
    
    if (!in_array($extension, $allowed)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check MIME type
    $allowed_types = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'application/pdf', 'text/plain'];
    if (!in_array($file['type'], $allowed_types)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Additional security checks...
    return true;
}
```
